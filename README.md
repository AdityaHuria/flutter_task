# Flutter Task for joining MUNSoc

![Build CI](https://github.com/munsoc-mpstme/flutter_task/workflows/Build%20CI/badge.svg)
Thanks for showing your interest in joining MUNSoc Tech! To test your Flutter and Git skills, we have a simple challenge for you - _fix the broken app!_

### Instructions

1.  Fork this repository to your account
2.  Clone (download) the fork to your computer
3.  Open the project in Android Studio/VSCode and run the app
4.  In case your laptop is slow/cannot install Flutter, you can use [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev/flutter) on the web and copy-paste the fixed code
5.  It will show you some errors. Fix the errors and commit your code!
6.  Create a Pull Request and send it to `munsoc-mpstme/flutter_task`
7.  Add us as a reviewer or ping us on the group once you're done!

**NOTE #1:** do NOT email us the code. We will only accept Pull Requests done through GitHub. If you don't know how to use it, learn it! There are plenty of tutorials online.

**NOTE #2:** if you don't have Flutter/Git installed, no need to waste time installing it. You can use [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev/flutter) on the web and copy-paste the fixed code directly in GitHub by [editing](https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Fmunsoc-mpstme%2Fflutter_task%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Flib%2Fmain.dart) the `main.dart` file and then sending the PR.

**NOTE #3:** if you have genuine problems, feel free to reach out to us. But remember - this is a _test_, so don't ask us for direct help!
